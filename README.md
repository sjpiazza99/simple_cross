SimpleCross - a process that matches internal orders

Overview:
    * Accept/remove orders as they are entered and keep a book of
      resting orders  *HASHMAP*
    * Determine if an accepted order would be satisfied by previously
      accepted orders (i.e. a buy would cross a resting sell)
    * Output (print) crossing events and remove completed (fully filled)
      orders from the book

Inputs: *REGEX FOR THESE*
    A string of space separated values representing an action.  The number of
    values is determined by the action to be performed and have the following
    format:

    ACTION [OID [SYMBOL SIDE QTY PX]]

    ACTION: single character value with the following definitions
    O - place order, requires OID, SYMBOL, SIDE, QTY, PX
    X - cancel order, requires OID
    P - print sorted book (see example below)

    OID: positive 32-bit integer value which must be unique for all orders

    SYMBOL: alpha-numeric string value. Maximum length of 8.

    SIDE: single character value with the following definitions
    B - buy
    S - sell

    QTY: positive 16-bit integer value

    PX: positive double precision value (7.5 format)

map[symbols][bids][ORDID] => model it after crypto exchanges (some struct)
map[symbols][asks][ORDID] =>

    FILL_QTY: positive 16-bit integer value representing qty of the order filled by
              this crossing event

    OPEN_QTY: positive 16-bit integer value representing qty of the order not yet filled

    FILL_PX:  positive double precision value representing price of the fill of this
              order by this crossing event (7.5 format)

    ORD_PX:   positive double precision value representing original price of the order (7.5 format)

Conditions/Assumptions:
    * The implementation should be a standalone Linux console application (include
      source files, testing tools and Makefile in submission)
    * The app should respond to malformed input and other errors with a RESULT
      of type 'E' and a descriptive error message
    * Development should be production level quality. Design and
      implementation choices should be documented
	* Performance is always a concern in software, but understand that this is an unrealistic test. 
	  Only be concerned about performance where it makes sense to the important sections of this application (i.e. reading actions.txt is not important).
    * All orders are standard limit orders
    * Orders should be selected for crossing using price-time (FIFO) priority
    * Orders for different symbols should not cross (i.e. the book must support multiple symbols)

If you have questions or need any clarification about the problem you can
